\section{Carlo}
\label{app:instructions:carlo}

Carlo\footnote{\url{https://github.com/aasewold/carlo}}
is a Python client that connects to the CARLA simulator
and interacts with it in different ways.
The main use of Carlo in this research is to connect and record images
from the camera sensors TransFuser receive input data from.

Carlo can be run on \nap using Docker
and attached to a running CARLA simulator on localhost port 2000 using the following commands after cloning the Carlo repository and entering the directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
docker-compose up --build
\end{lstlisting}
