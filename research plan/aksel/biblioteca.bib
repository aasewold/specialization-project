    abstract = {Although the level of safety required before drivers will accept self-driving cars is not clear, the criterion of being safer than a human driver has become pervasive in the discourse on vehicle automation. This criterion actually means “safer than the average human driver,” because it is necessarily defined with respect to population-level data. At the level of individual risk assessment, a body of research has shown that most drivers perceive themselves to be safer than the average driver (the better-than-average effect). Method: Using an online sample, this study examined U.S. drivers’ ratings of their own ability to drive safely and their desired level of safety for self-driving vehicles. Results: This study replicated the better-than average effect and showed that most drivers stated a desire for self-driving cars that are safer than their own perceived ability to drive safely before they would: (1) feel reasonably safe riding in a self-driving vehicle; (2) buy a self-driving vehicle, all other things (cost, etc.) being equal; and (3) allow self-driving vehicles on public roads. Conclusions: Since most drivers believe they are better than average drivers, the benchmark of achieving automation that is safer than a human driver (on average) may not represent acceptably safe performance of self-driving cars for most drivers. Practical applications: If perceived level of safety is an important contributor to acceptance of self-driving vehicles, the popular “safer than a human driver” benchmark may not be adequate for widespread acceptance.}

AV test drivers in CA mandatorily self-report every crash, whereas average drivers underreport minor accidents, so the UMTRI reporting correction factor permits comparison. CA's AV AM mileage is only a few million miles over the last few years, with virtually no police-reported crash data yet available. OL 316 crash consequence data (e.g., damage, injuries, etc.) is anecdotal and inconsistently self-reported. The CA collision report data indicate the CA AV test fleet exhibits multiples of the human crash frequency. Invariably, the AV accidents are the human driver's fault, with a majority being rear collisions. The human drivers appear less able to anticipate the AV's more conservative driving. CA's AV experience predicts more widespread deployment of existing AV technologies is not likely to reduce vehicle crash frequency, at least in the short term, and might well increase it.}",

abstract={Accidents involving autonomous vehicles (AVs) raise difficult ethical dilemmas and legal issues. It has been argued that self-driving cars should be programmed to kill, that is, they should be equipped with pre-programmed approaches to the choice of what lives to sacrifice when losses are inevitable. Here we shall explore a different approach, namely, giving the user/passenger the task (and burden) of deciding what ethical approach should be taken by AVs in unavoidable accident scenarios. We thus assume that AVs are equipped with what we call an ``Ethical Knob'', a device enabling passengers to ethically customise their AVs, namely, to choose between different settings corresponding to different moral approaches or principles. Accordingly, AVs would be entrusted with implementing users' ethical choices, while manufacturers/programmers would be tasked with enabling the user's choice and ensuring implementation by the AV.},
