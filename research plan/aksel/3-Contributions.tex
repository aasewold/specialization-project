\subsection*{Contributions}

This research will bring the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implementation of snowy weather in the CARLA simulator, as well as effects like slippery roads and reduced sensory range.
    \item Modifications to the TransFuser agent to predict weather conditions.
    \item Weather-specific rules to limit the action space of TransFuser to safer choices.
    \item Quantitative comparisons of model \textbf{A}, \textbf{B} and \textbf{C} in various weather conditions,
    that shows how the weather and weather-specific rules impact the SDVs' safety and driving performance.
\end{enumerate}

Considering the current lack of adverse weather in CARLA,
these contributions are a novel addition to the simulator and related literature.
The contributions will enable further research into the effects of adverse weather,
and increase focus on snowy climates by implementing winter conditions in an already popular research tool.
