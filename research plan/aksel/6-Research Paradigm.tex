\subsection*{Research Paradigm}

In this research we adopt a positivist approach.
We begin by reproducing the results from the original TransFuser agent to establish the validity of our implementation.
The impact of adverse weather on driving safety is then quantitatively measured,
and we measure the effect of weather-specific safety rules.
The results are subjected to statistical tests to see whether the rules demonstrably affect the agents safety performance.
