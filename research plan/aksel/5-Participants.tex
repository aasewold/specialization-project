\subsection*{Participants and Ethical Considerations}

This research is conducted by myself,
together with my thesis supervisor Frank Lindseth and co-supervisor Gabriel Kiss.
Data generation and processing happens purely digitally,
with no external subjects involved.

However, this does not relieve the research from ethical considerations,
especially not within the fields of machine learning and autonomous driving.
Image classification models have previously been shown to exhibit
sexist and racist behaviours \cite{yapo2018ethical}.
SDVs have been the subject of several ethical discussions.
For instance, if a fatal accident is inevitable,
should the vehicle preferentially protect its passengers or pedestrians \cite{Contissa2017}? 
If not carefully implemented,
SDVs might preferentially hurt racial minorities due to imbalances in the dataset.
Answers to these problems are difficult to formulate exactly,
but being aware of these issues is one step towards removing the researchers' inherent bias from transferring to the models.
