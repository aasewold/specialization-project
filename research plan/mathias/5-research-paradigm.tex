\section*{Research Paradigm}
The underlying research paradigm for our project is positivism. The three basic techniques of the scientific method described by Oates all apply to this research project \cite{oates}; it breaks a complex problem into smaller and more interpretable experiments, the experiments are repeatable and the hypothesis is refutable. Other characteristics of positivism that apply to our research questions are objectivity, quantitative data analysis and measuring.
