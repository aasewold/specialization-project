\section*{Contributions}
Our project will contribute with research of the knowledge gap in road detection using snow poles. More specifically, we will provide a report documenting experiments and results of adding snow pole detection to a current state-of-the-art model for autonomous driving in CARLA. This includes modifying a built-in map to include snow covered roads and snow poles, as this does not currently exist. The map can also be used to generate training data which can be useful for researchers such as \cite{Autonomous-Steering-in-Adverse-Road-and-Weather-Conditions}. Both the new analysis and CARLA contributions will be made publicly available to motivate further research and discussion around the topic of autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions.

- C6: The deliverables of the research study are clearly stated.
    This point is simply related to what you will deliver
    from your research. Are we talking about a report? A
    design concept? A product? A scientific paper?
- C7: The new knowledge resulting from the deliverables is clearly described related to the knowledge gap and addresses
the research questions.

Contributions:
- Snow map in CARLA
- Snow poles in CARLA
- If snow poles can be recognized by sensors in autonomous vehicles
- If snow poles can help with navigation
