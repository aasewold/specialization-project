\section*{Final Deliverables and Dissemination}
The results of the research project will mainly be the written master thesis along with source code for the experiments and implementation of the modified CARLA map. In addition to being shared through NTNU's channels, the master thesis and code will be openly available on GitHub. With this we hope that the topic will be further experimented with and discussed by the research community. We will also contact the team behind CARLA about including the snow map in the simulator, hopefully reaching more of the community.
