\section{Tools and Resources}

Training vision transformers is a computationally heavy task.
To fulfill the computational demands during this research,
we have utilized three main computational resources.


\subsection{IDI Horizon}

For local development and small-scale testing,
we have used virtual machines from
IDI Horizon - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure for Visual Computing.
These are equipped with NVIDIA A10-24Q GPUs and CUDA version 11.4.
Virtual desktop access have been available through VMWare Horizon \cite{software:vmware:horizon}.


\subsection{\texttt{nap02}}

For longer training sessions,
we have used the \texttt{nap02}-server,
a bare-bones computer equipped with
2x Intel Xeon Gold 6342 CPUs,
2x NVIDIA A100 80G GPUs with CUDA version 11.6,
and 512 GiB RAM.


\subsection{Idun}

Finally,
to prepare for a larger amount of experiments during the master thesis,
we have built tooling and documentation to utilize the Idun High Performance Computing cluster.
Idun provides 864 CPU cores and 80 NVIDIA GPUs to the Department of Computer Science \cite{idun:overview},
and thus enables a much higher degree of parallelization for future experiments.
The cluster is managed using the Slurm Workload Manager \todo{cite {slurm}}.
