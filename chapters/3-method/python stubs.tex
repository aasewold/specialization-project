\section{Creating Python Stubs for CARLA}
\label{sec:python-stubs}
While CARLA provides an extensive Python interface for it's client-server functionality, it lacks proper typing of classes and methods. This mean that we lose the possibility of auto-completion, documentation and type checking in the code editor while developing, features that normally speeds up the process and helps prevent unwanted mistakes. An issue requesting this was raised in 2019 on the CARLA repository, but have to this date not been resolved \cite{carla-python-stubs-issue}. We therefore created a new tool for automatically generating Python stubs files based on the CARLA Python API docs \cite{carla-python-api}. The stub files contain type hints to be used by the type checker during development, and are not used during runtime. Currently we have only generated stub files for CARLA version 0.9.13, but they can also be generated for other version. The generator source code, stub files and installation instructions are all available at our GitHub repository.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/aasewold/carla-python-stubs}}
