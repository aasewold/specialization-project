\chapter{Experiments and Results}
\label{chap:results}

% The results chapter should simply present the results of applying the methods presented in the method chapter without further ado. This chapter will typically contain many graphs, tables, etc. Sometimes it is natural to discuss the results as they are presented, combining them into a "Results and Discussion" chapter, but more often they are kept separate.
